This mod provides a persistant player database.
It is based on a mod I found in the forum.

History:
I wanted to save locations per player and have them persist between games.
So a search in the Minetest mod forum I found Addi's approach and liked it.
To learn and understand how it works, I went through the code line by line
changeing things here and there as we went. But basically it is still what Addi
had provided.
