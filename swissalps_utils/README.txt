SwissalpS Utilities Minetest Mod [swissalps_utils]
Written by Luke Zimmermann aka SwissalpS

This mod provides functions for common tasks.
Some methods are taken from Minetest source on github.com. I.e. pos_to_string().
This because some distros are not as up to date as I'd like.
math.round originates from [compassgps]
The remainder are my own creation.
