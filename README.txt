SwissalpS' Minetest Mods
Written by Luke Zimmermann aka SwissalpS
Luke@SwissalpS.ws

This mod-pack includes these mods:
SwissalpS DB - a persistent player database
SwissalpS Door Steward - automatic doors
SwissalpS Info - all my mods use this in some way
SwissalpS Teleport - teleport to bookmarks by chat-command or pad
SwissalpS Utils - some utilities. Some functions taken from newer versions of Minetest

History:
I wanted to see how well one could script for Minetest and got somewhat hooked.
What started as a simple mod, grew into a larger project.
Maybe I'll find time to continue the effort, until then, this mod-pack is
provided AS-IS.

Read LICENSE.txt and the README.txt file in each mod-folder for more information.
